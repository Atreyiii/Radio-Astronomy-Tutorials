# Radio Astronomy Tutorials
## INTRODUCTION TO RADIO ASTRONOMY

Radio astronomy is a specialized branch of astronomy that focuses on the study of celestial objects and phenomena using radio waves. Unlike visible light or other forms of electromagnetic radiation, radio waves have longer wavelengths and lower frequencies, making them ideal for exploring various aspects of the universe. The field of radio astronomy has witnessed remarkable advancements since its inception in the 1930s, revolutionizing our understanding of cosmic phenomena.

The radio waves emitted by celestial objects provide unique insights into their properties, including temperature, composition, and magnetic fields. Radio telescopes, specifically designed to detect and analyze radio emissions, play a crucial role in capturing these faint signals from space. These telescopes are often large parabolic dishes equipped with sophisticated receivers and data processing systems.

Radio astronomy has enabled groundbreaking discoveries, such as the detection of pulsars, quasars, and the cosmic microwave background radiation - a remnant of the Big Bang. It has also played a vital role in unraveling the mysteries of galaxies, star formation processes, and the interstellar medium.

Moreover, radio astronomy complements other astronomical observations, offering a multi-wavelength perspective on celestial objects and allowing astronomers to create comprehensive images of the universe. Interferometry, a technique that combines signals from multiple radio telescopes, further enhances the resolving power of radio astronomy, enabling the study of fine details in distant objects.

In recent years, advancements in technology have led to the development of radio interferometric arrays, such as the Very Large Array (VLA) and the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), which have expanded our ability to observe the cosmos with unprecedented sensitivity and resolution.

With ongoing developments and the potential of future radio telescopes, radio astronomy continues to be at the forefront of astronomical research, promising exciting new insights into the origins, evolution, and fundamental nature of the universe.


## What will we learn from these tutorials?

I have aimed to develop a proficient understanding of radio astronomy by exploring its foundational concepts and applying them to analyze data collected from radio telescopes using CASA (Common Astronomy Software Applications) software. The project focuses on hands-on learning, delving into the principles underlying radio astronomy and utilizing CASA to process and interpret data obtained from radio
telescopes. The results are further effectively understood by appropriate plots. This report provides a comprehensive learning experience that enables participants to gain proficiency in the fundamental aspects of radio astronomy and its data analysis techniques, with a specific focus on CASA software as a powerful tool for radio astronomical research. We have utilized MCMC as a powerful data sampler, enabling us to explore complex models and extract reliable parameter estimates. Additionally, we investigated fast radio bursts (FRBs) and their dispersion measure (DM) values, which provide valuable information about the intervening medium and the sources of these energetic bursts.
